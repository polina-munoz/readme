# about me

Hi there! My name is Polina, and I’m currently a Software Engineer at [Indiegogo](https://www.indiegogo.com). I’m very passionate about building for the web– software engineering is a means through which I can be proud of building services that empower those around me.

I graduated from [Wellesley College](http://campaign.wellesley.edu/this-is-the-place) with a degree in Computer Science and currently reside in San Francisco. When I’m not coding, you can find me listening to podcasts, running, and learning about the world and people through stories.
